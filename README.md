# orwell_basics

with the fun_explore branch I'm trying to learn integration of Rstudio and git
my plan is to somehow get the orwell.R file imported into rstudio without me copying/pasting it

Lets see if I shall success

checkout the git course from John Hopkins
I'm sure I've done this before, like 3 years ago. Jesus!
